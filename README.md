# Material Design Animations
<p>Here we can find the following animations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explode Animation</li>
<li>Fade Animation</li>
<li>Slide Animation</li>
<li>Shared Elements Animation</li>
</ul>

These animations can be done by code or through xml files. There is an example of both ways. The code is written in Kotlin.
